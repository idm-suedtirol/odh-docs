 Introduction
==============

This is the website of the Open Data Hub documentation, a collection
of technical resources about the Open Data Hub project. The website
serves as the main resource portal for everyone interested in
accessing the data or deploying apps based on :term:`datasets
<Dataset>` & :term:`API`\s provided by the Open Data Hub team.

The technical stuff is composed of:

* Catalogue of available datasets.
* How-tos, FAQs, and various tips and tricks for users.
* Links to the full API documentation.
* Resources for developers.

Project Overview
================

The Open Data Hub project envisions the development and set up of a
portal whose primary purpose is to offer a single access point to all
(Open) Data from the region of South Tyrol, Italy, that are relevant
for the economy sector and its actors.

The availability of Open Data from a single source will allow
everybody to utilise the Data in several ways:

* Digital communication channels. Data are retrieved from the Open Data Hub
  and used to provide informative services, like newsletters
  containing weather forecasting, or used in hotels to promote events
  taking place in the surroundings, along with additional information
  like seat availability, description, how to access each event, and
  so on and so forth.
* Applications for any devices, built on top of the data, that can be
  either a :abbr:`PoC (Proof of Concept)` to explore new means or new
  fields in which to use Open Data Hub data, or novel and innovative services
  or software products built on top of the data.
* Internet portals and websites. Data are retrieved from the Open Data Hub and
  visualised within graphical charts, graphs, or maps.

There are many services and software that rely on Open Data Hub's
Data, which are listed in the :ref:`applist` section, grouped
according to their maturity: production stage, beta and alpha stage.

   An overview of the Open Data Hub Project.

:numref:`domains-diagram` gives a high level overview of the flow of
data within the Open Data Hub: at the bottom, :term:`sensors <Sensor>`
gather data from various domains, which are fed to the Open Data Hub
Big Data infrastructure and made available through endpoints to
(third-party) applications, web sites, and vocal assistants. A more
technical and in-depth overview can be found in next section,
:ref:`architecture-odh`.
	
All the data within the Open Data Hub will be easily accessible,
preferring open interfaces and APIs which are built on existing
standards like `The Open Travel Alliance <https://opentravel.org/>`_
(OTA), `The General Transit Feed Specification <https://gtfs.org/>`_
(GTFS), `Alpinebits <https://www.alpinebits.org/>`_.

The Open Data Hub team also strives to keep all data regularly
updated, and use standard exchange formats for them like `Json
<http://www.json.org/>`_ and the `Data Catalog Vocabulary
<https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/>`_ (DCAT) to facilitate their
spreading and use. Depending on the development of the project and the
interest of users, more standards and data formats might be supported
in the future.
