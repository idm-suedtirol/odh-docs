A :term:`Domain` is a category that contains entities that are closely
related. In the |odh|, each domain roughly identifies one social or
economical category; the domains intended as sources for data served
by the |odh| are depicted at the bottom of :numref:`domains-diagram`.

Currently, the domains that can be accessed through the |odh| are:

#. :strong:`Mobility`: this domain contains data about public
   transportation, parkings, charging station, and so on.
#. :strong:`Tourism`: data about events, accomodations, points of
   interest, and so on.
#. :strong:`Other` domain: a special category that encompasses domains
   that do not fall in any of the above category.

Each domain is composed by datasets, each of which contains data
that provide useful information for the domain.

.. note:: There may be no clear separation between two domains,
   because for example, data about public transportation belong to the
   Mobility domain, but are also useful for the Tourism domain.

.. seealso:: The list of datasets that belong to each domain can be
   found in the dedicated sections: :ref:`mobility-datasets`,
   :ref:`tourism-datasets`, and :ref:`other-domains-datasets`.
